```
prob = (K over k)(N-K over n-k)/(N over n)
```
where newton's symbol tells in how many ways you can draw k cards from n cards deck
```
(n over k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)
```
* N - deck size
* K - number of desired cards in deck
* n - number of draws
* k - number of desired cards in hand which are required to success
